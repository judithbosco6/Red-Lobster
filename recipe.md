After preparing your lobster tails, you will make a butter garlic herb that will be brushed over each of the meat sticking out.
Preheat the oven to broil or 500 degrees. Start by preparing the lobster. Using kitchen shears butterfly the tail by cutting down the center. Loosen the meat and pull the lobster meat upward. Salt and pepper the meat and set on a baking sheet.
Whisk together the garlic herb butter. In a small bowl whisk together the melted butter, garlic, paprika, thyme, rosemary, and parsley. Spread evenly on each one.
Broil: Broil the lobster for about 8-10 minutes or until the meat is lightly brown on the top. Serve with melted butter if desired.
